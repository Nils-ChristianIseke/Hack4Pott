# Hack4Pott
In cocking plants, chimney get constricted by deposits, which hinders their performance. Thus they need to be maintained which is a time-consuming process.
The detection of constrictions is helpful to do the maintainence on the right time.

Segmentation of constrictions in conking plant chemneys.
This was done during 24hs at the hackathon #Hack4Pott.
Be aware that the images in segmentation_results are not showing much with a normal image viewer, cause they only contain 1 and 2 as values. Look at the Example_Segmentation.png to get the results.
