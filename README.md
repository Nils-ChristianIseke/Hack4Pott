# Hack4Pott
This was done during 24hs at the hackathon #Hack4Pott.

In cocking plants, chimney get constricted by deposits, which hinders their performance. Thus they need to be maintained which is a time-consuming process.
The detection of constrictions is helpful to do the maintainence on the right time.

Segmentation of constrictions in conking plant chemneys.
Be aware that the images in segmentation_results are not showing much with a normal image viewer, cause they only contain 1 and 2 as values. Look at the Examples below to get a glimpse of the performance. This was achieved by using only 23 labeled images as input.
